### Menus ###

Our themes use WordPress’s custom menus option. These can be created in Appearance > Menus. This theme supports two menu positions: Top and Main. The Top location appears at the very top of the site, above all headers and content. The Main location appears just after the site logo, site description and header image. To add a new menu to your site:

1. Go to Appearance > Menus.
2. Create a new menu item by clicking the + tab.
3. Select the pages you want to display in your menu and click the Add to Menu button. If you do not see the type of page (category, tag, portfolio, gallery, etc) you want to display, click the Screen Options link at the top of the page and make sure the page type is checked.
4. Once you have set your menu as you want it, click the Save Menu button.
5. Then, assign that menu to your desired theme location to ensure your menu appears where you want it and click Save.

### Post Formats ###

Stock Photography supports the following post formats &mdash; standard, image, gallery, video &mdash;.

* Standard Post Formats - Use the Standard Post Format to display whatever you insert into the visual editor on the homepage and on single posts. Be sure to upload and assign a Featured Image for each post.

* Image Post Formats - Create a post and assign it to the Image Post Format. Be sure to set a Featured Image.

* Gallery Post Formats - To show a gallery, create a post and assign it to the Gallery Post Format. Upload as many images as you like using the media uploader tool and insert the Gallery into the post. This will add the gallery shorcode to the page, which looks like this in HTML mode: [gallery ids="1,2,3,4"]. Be sure to assign a Featured Image for that post. For best results, use images that are at least 960 pixels wide. All posts assigned to the Gallery Post Format will then display image slideshow.

To insert a gallery:

1. Click on the Add Media button to launch the Media Uploader tool.
2. Click the Create Gallery option.
3. You can choose to upload images from your computer or you can use images that already exist in your Media Library. You cannot use an image from a URL on the web in your gallery.
4. If you are uploading images, click the Select Files button and navigate to each of your images on your computer. Click the Open button to open each image.
5. Once each of your images has been uploaded, you will have the option to add a title, caption, alternative text and description.
6. After you have added all of the images you wish to display in the gallery, switch to your media library tab and select those images.
7. Then, click the Create a New Gallery button

![Insert a Gallery](http://graphpaperpress.s3.amazonaws.com/images/instructions/insert_gallery.png)

* Video Post Formats - Create a post and assign it to the Video Post Format. Paste the URL to the video you want to display into the editor. Be sure to set a Featured Image.


### Embed Multimedia into Posts or Pages ###

For externally hosted videos (for example a YouTube or Vimeo video), you can directly paste the link of your video page into the content editor. You do not have to paste the embed code. WordPress will automatically embed the video from the link.

You can easily embed videos from a Video hosting service such as Vimeo or YouTube into your posts or pages.

To add a video:

1. From your WordPress dashboard, add a new post or page (or edit an existing post or page).
2. Paste in your video’s URL, for example https://vimeo.com/31985752.
3. Publish or Update your post or page.

*Please note: If your video is not appearing correctly, remove the ‘s’ from the URL, so https becomes http.*

### Contributors ##

You can mark any of your WordPress users as "Contributors" so that they show up on the Contributor page (see the Page Templates section below for more info on creating the Contributor page). To add a contributor, you need to create a user profile for each user and check them as a contributor. You can do that by going to WordPress dashboard > Users. Edit a user and check "Contributor" option under "Profile Information" section.

To add social media icons for each contributor, simply fill out Twitter, Facebook, Google +, YouTube, Vimeo fields.


### Page Templates ###

Stock Photography comes with five page templates (Default, Blog, Collections, Contributors, Dashboard, Lightbox). Each page template serves a specific role in the operation of your site if you have want to sell photos from the Stock Photography theme. You will want to create a new page for each of the following Page Templates (excluding the Default template):

1. Default - the default page template with an optional sidebar.
2. Blog - pulls in all of your Posts into one paginated page.
3. Collections - pulls in all of your Sell Media Collections into one page.
4. Contributors - pulls in all users marked as "Contributors" on their user profile page.
5. Dashboard - the page where your customers can download their purchases, view purchase history and see their profile information.

### Setting up the Lightbox ###
Setting up the Lightbox is a two step process:

1. Create a new Page called "Lighbox" and add this shortcode to the page: '[sell_media_lightbox]'
2. Add the new Lightbox page to the Top Menu. You need to apply a custom CSS class to the Lightbox menu link. Toggle open the menu link using the arrow icon. If you don't see the CSS Classes option, click the Screen Options link in the top right of the page and make sure the CSS Classes option is checked under the "Show advanced menu options" subheading. Add the css class "lightbox-menu" to the CSS classes option for the Lightbox menu link. This special CSS class will append the lighbox counter box right beside the Lightbox menu link on your site. Below is a screenshot of the Lightbox link menu css class:
